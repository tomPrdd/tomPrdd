👋 Greetings! I'm Tom.

🌍 Originally from France, I bring an international perspective shaped by diverse educational experiences in both business and engineering.

🎓 I graduated in Industrial Sales Engineering from a French business school a few months ago, with a strong foundation in business-related disciplines. However, I soon discovered my passion for blending business with data science. Motivated by this realization, I embarked on a self-taught journey to learn data science and launched my career in this exciting field.

💻 Today, I work as a junior data scientist at Michelin Connected Fleet in London.
