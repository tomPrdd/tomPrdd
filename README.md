Greetings! I'm Tom. 👋

🌍 Hailing from France, I pride myself on having an international perspective, fortified by my diverse educational 
pursuits in both the realms of business and engineering.

🎓 Currently, I'm navigating an enriching academic path. I'm delving into Industrial Business Engineering at ESTA, 
Belfort, while simultaneously earning a dual degree in Data Science (taught in English) at UTBM, Belfort. 
Complementing my formal education, I'm also immersing myself in specialized certification courses centered 
around Business Intelligence. This encompasses a spectrum of skills from Data Management, Data Analysis, 
and programming languages like Python and R, to tools such as SQL, Power BI, and Excel.

🌟 Driven by a proactive mindset, I harbor a fervent passion for harnessing the power of data to sculpt 
informed business strategies. With a solid academic foundation and a suite of specialized skills, I'm eager to 
translate my theoretical knowledge into actionable insights, aiming to leave a meaningful imprint on any organization I collaborate with.
